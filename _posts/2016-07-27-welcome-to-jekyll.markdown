Off to learn yet another language and tool! I hope to replace my hard-to-manage
HostGator site with the simpler site managed with Jekyll, which is based on the
Ruby programming language.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
